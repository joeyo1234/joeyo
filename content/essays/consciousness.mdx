I recently stumbled upon a unique theory of consciousness that is inspired by the way computation works when prompt engineering on ChatGPT. I decided to write a piece exploring the theory just for fun. My theory seeks to challenge the age old hard problem of consciousness.

## The Hard Problem

Imagine you're sitting in a room, and in front of you is a ripe, delicious-looking red apple. You reach out, take a bite, and instantly, there's a burst of sweetness, a crisp texture, and the bright beautiful red that fills your vision.

Have you ever wondered what turns these physical interactions into the vivid experience of sweetness, crunchiness, or "redness"?

This question lies at the heart of what's known as the "Hard Problem of Consciousness", coined by philosopher David Chalmers in the 1990s.

## My Theory: Layered Cognition

The brain generates conscious experience to offer more time for cognition to promote survival. What is included in consciousness is what the brain determines is most meaningful for survival, and the brain's own meta-assessment of meaning creates conscious subjective experience.

### The Layers

**Level 1:** The brain processes sensory information that the apple is red in the occipital lobe and spreads this information across the brain.

**Level 2:** The brain selects the sight of the red apple to be brought into consciousness (into the replay mechanism) to give more time for cognition because it concludes the redness is meaningful for survival.

**Level 3:** Within the replay mechanism, the brain then assigns a level of meaning to the sight of the redness itself as part of its mechanism to assess its level of meaning. This meta-assessment is included in the experience of consciousness itself to give more time for cognition, and it gives us the experience of feeling.

## Conclusion

We have beautiful evolution-optimised minds and it feels like we can choose what we believe to be meaningful. And that which we find meaningful is what our consciousness largely becomes, so we should choose wisely.
