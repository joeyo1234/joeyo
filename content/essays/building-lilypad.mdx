Every year, millions of students wait months—sometimes over a year—for the psychological evaluations they need to access special education services. The system is broken, and I'm building Lilypad to fix it.

## The Problem

Schools across America face a critical shortage of licensed psychologists who can conduct comprehensive learning evaluations. Students who need support are stuck in limbo, falling further behind while they wait.

This isn't just an inconvenience. For a child with dyslexia, ADHD, or autism, delayed diagnosis means delayed intervention. Every month of waiting is a month of struggle that could have been addressed.

## The Solution

Lilypad connects students with licensed psychologists for on-demand evaluations. We're building the infrastructure to make psychological assessments accessible, fast, and high-quality.

Our platform handles the complexity—scheduling, compliance, documentation—so psychologists can focus on what they do best: understanding and helping students.

## Why This Matters

Education is the great equalizer, but only if every student can access the support they need. A child's potential shouldn't be limited by a bureaucratic backlog.

We're not just building a business. We're building a future where every student gets the help they need, when they need it.
